### Atonal 3D synth experiment

This sort of a synth creates atonal, horrifying soundscapes. Every vertex is an oscillator. Uses Three.js (r.79) library and Web Audio API.

Code is sort of a mess as this was done quickly for my own purposes. Feel free to fork and develop the idea further if you will!
